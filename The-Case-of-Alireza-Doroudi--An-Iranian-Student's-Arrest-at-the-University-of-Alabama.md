In March 2025, Alireza Doroudi, a 32-year-old Iranian doctoral student at the University of Alabama, was arrested by immigration agents at his apartment in the middle of the night. Despite having permission to stay in the United States while pursuing his studies, Doroudi's visa was revoked in 2023, leading to his detention. His lawyer, David Rozas, stated that Doroudi had not engaged in any campus protests or criminal activities. The Department of Homeland Security cited "significant national security concerns" as the reason for his arrest but did not provide specific details. Doroudi was held at the Pickens County Jail in Carrollton, Alabama, before being transferred to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention center in Jena, Louisiana. This case is part of a broader trend of immigration enforcement targeting college students, raising questions about due process and the treatment of international students in the U.S. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/ae498838deb04b22864ef485a71bac27?utm_source=openai))
