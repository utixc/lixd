On March 28, 2025, a catastrophic event unfolded in Bangkok, Thailand, when a 30-story skyscraper under construction collapsed following a powerful 7.7-magnitude earthquake that originated in Myanmar. This tragedy resulted in the loss of at least 60 lives, with 34 individuals still missing as of April 24, 2025.

**Background of the Collapse**

The building, located on Kamphaeng Phet 2 Road near the Chatuchak Weekend Market, was intended to house the State Audit Office. Construction had commenced in 2020, and by April 2024, the structure had topped out, reaching its full height. At the time of the collapse, the building was approximately 30% complete, with work ongoing on the glass facade and internal installations.

**The Earthquake and Its Impact**

The earthquake struck at 12:50:54 MMT (06:20:54 UTC) on March 28, 2025, with its epicenter near Mandalay, Myanmar. Despite Bangkok's distance from the epicenter, the city's soft soil amplified the seismic waves, leading to significant tremors. The collapse of the skyscraper was the most severe structural failure in Bangkok during this event, highlighting the building's vulnerability to seismic forces.

**Casualties and Rescue Operations**

The collapse resulted in at least 60 confirmed deaths, with nine individuals injured and 34 missing. Among the deceased were ten migrant workers from Myanmar and a Cambodian national. Rescue operations were launched immediately, with teams working tirelessly to locate survivors. International assistance was also sought, with countries like the United States and Israel deploying personnel and equipment to aid in the search efforts.

**Investigation into the Collapse**

Thai authorities, including Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra and Industry Minister Akanat Promphan, initiated investigations into the collapse. The focus was on assessing the construction quality, materials used, and adherence to building codes, especially concerning earthquake resilience. On March 30, 2025, anomalies were found in the steel samples taken from the site. Further scrutiny revealed that substandard steel bars, branded "Sky," produced by Xin Ke Yuan Steel Co., were used in the construction. This company had faced safety violations in the past, including a factory fire in December 2024.

**Legal Actions and Accountability**

In response to the findings, Thai authorities took legal action. On April 19, 2025, Justice Minister Tawee Sodsong announced the arrest of a Chinese national representing China Railway No. 10 Engineering Group, the state-run Chinese contractor involved in the project. Additionally, arrest warrants were issued for three Thai shareholders associated with the project. These actions underscore the government's commitment to holding parties accountable for the tragedy.

**Implications for Construction Safety in Bangkok**

The collapse has raised significant concerns about construction safety standards in Bangkok. Governor Chadchart Sittipunt emphasized the need for stricter building safety regulations and inspections. The city's soft soil conditions, which amplify seismic activity, further complicate construction practices. The prevalence of beamless design structures, which perform poorly during earthquakes, has also been identified as a contributing factor. The Thai Structural Engineers Association is assisting with inspections to ensure future compliance with earthquake safety requirements.

**Conclusion**

The collapse of the Bangkok skyscraper serves as a tragic reminder of the critical importance of stringent construction standards and thorough safety assessments, especially in seismically active regions. The ongoing investigations and legal actions aim to uncover the full extent of the failures and to implement measures that will prevent such disasters in the future. As Bangkok continues to grow and develop, ensuring the safety and resilience of its infrastructure remains paramount.
