On March 27, 2025, President Donald Trump signed Executive Order 14253, titled "Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History," aiming to reshape the Smithsonian Institution's portrayal of American history. This order mandates the removal of content deemed "improper, divisive, or anti-American" from the Smithsonian's museums, education and research centers, and the National Zoo.

**Background of Executive Order 14253**

Executive Order 14253 directs Vice President JD Vance, a member of the Smithsonian Board of Regents, to oversee the elimination of content considered to promote "improper ideology." The order specifically targets exhibits and programs that, according to the administration, "degrade shared American values, divide Americans based on race, or promote ideologies inconsistent with federal law and policy."

**Specific Targets of the Order**

The order highlights several areas of concern:

- **National Museum of African American History and Culture**: Critics have pointed out that certain exhibits in this museum have described aspects like hard work and the nuclear family as "aspects of 'White Culture.'"

- **Women's History Museum**: The forthcoming museum is under scrutiny for plans that may "recognize men as women," a move that the order seeks to prevent. ([wgal.com](https://www.wgal.com/article/trump-smithsonian-executive-order/64313725?utm_source=openai))

- **Restoration of Monuments**: The order calls for reinstating monuments, memorials, statues, and markers that were removed or altered since January 1, 2020, to "perpetuate a false reconstruction of American history."

**Reactions from the Smithsonian Institution**

The Smithsonian Institution, comprising 21 museums and the National Zoo, has not issued an official public response to the executive order. However, the institution has previously taken steps in line with the administration's directives. In January 2025, the Smithsonian closed its Office of Diversity and froze federal hiring, aligning with the administration's broader efforts to eliminate "improper ideology" from federal institutions.

**Public and Institutional Responses**

The executive order has sparked a range of reactions:

- **Support from Conservative Groups**: Organizations like the Heritage Foundation have praised the order, viewing it as a necessary step to preserve American values and history.

- **Criticism from Historians and Educators**: Many scholars argue that the order may lead to the sanitization of history, potentially omitting critical discussions on race, gender, and other social issues.

- **Community Support for Affected Museums**: In response to the order, Black churches across the U.S. have rallied behind the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture, emphasizing the importance of preserving African American history.

**Implications for the Future of the Smithsonian**

The executive order signifies a substantial shift in the Smithsonian's operations, potentially affecting its funding, programming, and overall mission. The involvement of Vice President JD Vance in overseeing these changes indicates a high level of governmental oversight, which may alter the institution's traditionally independent status.

**Conclusion**

President Trump's Executive Order 14253 represents a significant intervention in the Smithsonian Institution's portrayal of American history. While the order aims to eliminate content deemed divisive or anti-American, it has raised concerns about the potential impact on historical accuracy and the institution's independence. The coming months will be crucial in determining how the Smithsonian navigates these directives and the broader discourse on the representation of history in public institutions.
