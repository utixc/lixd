In December 2024, the United States was shaken by the assassination of Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, outside a midtown Manhattan hotel. The alleged perpetrator, 26-year-old Luigi Mangione, has since been charged with multiple offenses, including murder as an act of terrorism. This case has not only captivated public attention but also raised significant legal and societal questions.

**Background of the Incident**

On December 4, 2024, Brian Thompson was fatally shot outside the New York Hilton Midtown, where UnitedHealth Group was scheduled to host an investor's meeting. Surveillance footage captured a masked gunman shooting Thompson from behind. Notably, shell casings found at the scene were inscribed with the words "deny," "delay," and "depose," terms associated with tactics used by health insurers to avoid paying claims.

**Arrest and Charges**

Following a five-day manhunt, Mangione was apprehended in Altoona, Pennsylvania. He was found in possession of a 9mm handgun matching the one used in the shooting, along with a notebook containing writings expressing hostility toward the health insurance industry and wealthy executives. In December 2024, Mangione was indicted on charges of first-degree and second-degree murder, with the first-degree charge specifically citing murder as an act of terrorism.

**Legal Proceedings**

In April 2025, Mangione pleaded not guilty to the federal murder charge in Manhattan federal court. Prosecutors announced their intent to seek the death penalty, marking the first such action since President Donald Trump resumed federal executions in 2025. Defense attorneys have criticized this move, arguing that it violates established protocols and Mangione's right to due process.

**Application of Terrorism Laws**

The inclusion of a terrorism charge in Mangione's indictment is noteworthy. New York law defines a "crime of terrorism" as an act intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population, influence government policy, or affect government conduct through murder, assassination, or kidnapping. Prosecutors argue that Mangione's actions were intended to terrorize the public and influence government policy regarding health insurance.

**Public Reaction and Support**

The case has sparked widespread public debate. Some view Mangione as a symbol of protest against high healthcare costs and the practices of health insurance companies. Supporters have organized rallies and online campaigns, and merchandise in support of Mangione appeared on various e-commerce platforms before being removed. A December 2024 poll found that many Americans believe health insurance companies' claim denials and profit motives contributed to Thompson's death.

**Implications for Health Insurance Reform**

The assassination has intensified calls for reform in the health insurance industry. Critics argue that practices such as claim denials and high premiums have led to public dissatisfaction and, in extreme cases, violence. The case underscores the need for a more transparent and equitable healthcare system.

**Conclusion**

The case of Luigi Mangione raises complex legal and ethical questions. As the legal proceedings continue, it is crucial to balance the pursuit of justice with the need to address the underlying issues within the healthcare system that have contributed to public unrest.
